The Myopen project has expanded in include a number of separate modules: EMG hardware 9wired and wireless), EMG software, wireless neural recording hardware, wireless control software, and wired neural recording software.  Everything is released under GPL v3. Below is the old introduction.

OPP is seeking to encourage experimentation with myoelectric control in order to inspire more rapid development of mechatronic prostheses for amputees. Because of the extremely small market size for upper extremity prosthetics, we think that one way to encourage this activity is to develop toys or user customizable devices that are capable of myoelectric signal processing. With wider access and experimentation with the technology, perhaps we could see interesting developments beyond the traditional venues of corporate R&D and educational institution research.

Along with a couple of collaborators (and we'd love to have more), we are exploring the development of an extremely flexible open hardware module that could be used with the Buglabs device, the LEGO NXT platform, and as a USB device that could be used with the OLPC (laptop.org), and traditional linux and windows computers. The components of the device would be modular, so we could populate them as needed, and use the same design for a variety of applications. The USB interface could also be used for connecting to game consoles, such as the Xbox360 and Playstation 3; the I2C bus may be useful for connecting to the Nintendo Wii via the Nunchuck input.
